## Description

The Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies has enabled me to develop the skills and competencies in the fields of data science, analytics, statistics, programming, and business. The unique blend of courses from both the Information Studies and Business school has prepared me to understand business needs, create data solutions, and iterate through data science frameworks. Through my coursework in Database Administration, Data Analytics, Scripting for Data Analysis, Text Mining, Big Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing, Marketing Analytics, and antitative Reasoning in Data Science
The Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies has enabled me to develop the skills and competencies in the fields of data science, analytics, statistics, programming, and business. The unique blend of courses from both the Information Studies and Business school has prepared me to understand business needs, create data solutions, and iterate through data science frameworks. Through my coursework in Database Administration, Data Analytics, Scripting for Data Analysis, Text Mining, Big Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing, Marketing Analytics, and Quantitative Reasoning in Data Science, I've demonstrated my skills and competencies by using machine learning algorithms and applied statistics to hypothesize outcomes, experiment, iterate, and synthesize results. Tools like Python, R, Tableau, Spark, and Adobe Illustrator were instrumental in the creation of projects found in this portfolio. 

The following artifacts demonstrate my proficiency in the core competencies of this program:

* Understand and communicate data science domains and applications
* Gather, organize, and integrate structured and unstructured data
* Identify patterns in data using visualization, statistics analysis, and data mining
* Develop alternative strategies using data exploration and manipulation 
* Design and implement data science frameworks to meet business needs 
* Demonstrate the ability to communicate insights and recommendations to a wider business audience
* Synthesize the ethical dimensions of the data science practice
